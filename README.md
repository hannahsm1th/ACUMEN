This was a team game design project for a 2D psychological RPG game built in Unity by myself and my team mate Mars Spanninga, using an AGILE development approach.

Mars was the artist, designer and writer. Decided the artstyle and drew the characters. As Mars was the one who wrote the original game pitch: had a big role in the
dialogue, character files and character creation. Also was the audio designer and found tracks and sound effects to fit the vibe of the game. I was the programmer and AGILE master. Programmed the entirety of the game including environment interaction and inventory systems, dialogue management system, refined code, feedback messages, puzzles and NPC interactions.

This summary is from our final game design submission and we both contributed to the documentation.

This code was used for a prototype with two levels demoing the environment interaction and inventory systems, dialogue management system, user feedback messages, puzzles, and NPC interactions.

The full game design document is located [here](./gamedocumentation.md), detailing the art, UI, level, and technical design of the project.
